# Bspice
My attempt at making a [SPICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE)-ish piece of software.
## Goals
My end goal is to have working simulation of all of the basic linear components (resistors, capacitors and inductors) and some non-linear components (diodes, operational amplifiers and transistors). 
Currently only resistors and capacitors work, more to come in the future.
